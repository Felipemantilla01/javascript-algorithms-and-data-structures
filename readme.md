# Searching Algorithms 

 How do we search?
 - Given an array, the simplest way to search for a value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

There are many different search methods on arrays in JavaScript:
- indexOf
- find
- includes
- index

all of those are based on linear search
