# Data Structures

## Linked Single List

It is a data structure that contains a `head`, `tail` and `length` property.
Linked list consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

## Stacks

Its a Data structure, LIFO (Last in First Out), we can create this using arrays, but will have unnecessary indexing, so its a good idea implementing like a singly linked list.

## Queues

Its a Data Structure, FIFO (First in First Out), we can create this using arrays, but will have unnecessary indexing, are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures
