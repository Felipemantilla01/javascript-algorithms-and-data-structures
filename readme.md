What is sorting?

- Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order

## Bubble Sort

The bubble sort is based on comparisons on each position of the array and its next, like arr[i] < arr[i+1], and swapping the numbers until no swaps happens.

## Selection Sort

Similar to Bubble sort, but insted of first placing large values into sorted position, it places small values into sorted position
