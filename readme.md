# Data Structures

## Linked Single List

It is a data structure that contains a `head`, `tail` and `length` property.
Linked list consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

## Stacks

Its a Data structure, LIFO (Last in First Out), we can create this using arrays, but will have unnecessary indexing, so its a good idea implementing like a singly linked list.

## Queues

Its a Data Structure, FIFO (First in First Out), we can create this using arrays, but will have unnecessary indexing, are useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures

## Trees

Tree terminology

- Root: The top node in a tree
- Child: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
- Parent: The converse notion of a child
- Siblings: A group of nodes with the same parent
- Leaf: A node with no children
- Edge: The connection between one node and another

### Binary Tree 

Must has only (max) two children per node. 

### Binary Search Tree 

In computer science, Binary Search Tree (BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary tree is a particular kind of data structure.

- every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent 
- every node to the right of a parent node is always greater that the parent
