# Recursion

It is a process (A function in our case) that calls itself

Everything use recursion 

- JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
- document.getElementById and DOM traversal Algorithms 
- Object traversal 
- We will see it in more complex data structures 
- It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
